# 10xers APP

You can see the datails in app folder

### note:

- If you want to run the app on your emulator, please change the local properties file acording to your sdk.dir settings. You can found it in the app folder `app/andorid/local.properties.example`.
- Rename the `local.properties.example` to `local.properties`.
- Please be remain that the wording of the path (in `local.properties`) is different acording to your OS (I use windows), you can find it on google.
